1. The data sources and self-assessment of the “challenge score”.

I will scrap and search information about 100 restaurants in Ann Arbor from TripAdvisor (sorted by ranking). Then, I will use Yelp Fusion API to get the ratings and geographical information (latitude and longitude) of the top 30 restaurants (according to TripAdvisor's ratings). The data will be stored in a database named "restaurants" for query and data visualization.

Challenge Score: 10 in total

6: Scraping 2 levels of pages ("https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g29556-Ann_Arbor_Michigan.html#EATERY_OVERVIEW_BOX" and the detail page of a single restaurant)
4: Yelp Fusion is a Web API I haven’t used before that requires API key or HTTP Basic authorization (https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews)



2. The presentation options (what information will be displayed).

First, I will scrape TripAdvisor's website with the goal of getting 100 restaurants' information in Ann Arbor. Information will include the restaurants' name, rating, review count, price range, address (from a single restaurant's page), etc.

Table 1: Restaurants (restaurants' Information)
Id (Primary Key)
Name
Rating1
ReviewCount
PriceRange
PageURL
Street
City
State
Zipcode

Then, I will use Yelp Fusion API to get the ratings and geographical info of the top 30 restaurants according to TripAdvisor's ranking.

3. The presentation tool(s)

plotly

(1) Scatter Map
A scatter map will be generated by plotly, and users will be directed to its web. It will show 50 restaurants in a city and allows users to interact with restaurants’ information. Point size indicates the level of ratings, with bigger size meaning higher rating. (https://plot.ly/python/scattermapbox/)

(2) Grouped bar chart with hover text
A grouped bar chart will be created to display the ratings and reviews' counts of the top 10 restaurants in terms of overall ratings in a city. (https://plot.ly/python/bar-charts/, trace 1: rating, trace 2: review counts)

(3) Grouped bar chart or Line chart
Same restaurants, two ratings given by TripAdvisor and Yelp respectively

(4) Other graphs
Grouping restaurants by price;
Grouping restaurants by rating;
Grouping restaurants by review counts;
Grouped bar charts based on the above information.



4. Cached files

(1) cache_tripa.json (saving restaurants' basic information gained through web scraping and crawling) 

(2) cache_yelp.json (saving restaurants' information gained through Yelp Fusion API)

(3) top_30.csv
